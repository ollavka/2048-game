## 📜 Rules of the game
* **Moving the tiles**: when the first tile appears on the field, it means the game has started! To get closer to victory you need to use only 4 keys: **up arrow, down arrow, left arrow and right arrow**. When you press each of these keys, all tiles on the field will move in the corresponding direction, if it possible.
* After each move, a new tile with the number 2 (90%) or number 4 (10%) will appear on the field.
* **To join the tiles into one**, you have to move a tile with a certain number in the direction of a tile with the same exact number and then one tile will be formed in which the number will be **X2**.<br />
